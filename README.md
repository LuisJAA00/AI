# AI Algorithms Collection

This repository contains implementations of classic AI algorithms using **Prolog** and **Python**. The included projects demonstrate different problem-solving techniques in artificial intelligence.

## Contents

### 1. Travelling Salesman Problem (Prolog)
A Prolog solution to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), which finds the shortest possible route that visits each city once and returns to the origin city.

üìÅ Path: `prolog/travelling_salesman.pl`

### 2. Tower of Hanoi Problem (Prolog)
A recursive Prolog implementation of the Tower of Hanoi problem, a classic example of problem-solving using recursion and logical planning.

üìÅ Path: `prolog/hanoi.pl`

### 3. Random Face Generation (Python)
A Python program that uses generative techniques (e.g., GANs or random facial feature composition) to create random human-like faces.

üìÅ Path: `python/random_face_generator.py`

## Requirements

- **Prolog** (e.g., SWI-Prolog)
- **Python 3.8+**
- Python libraries (if using face generation with ML):
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `opencv-python`
  - Or optionally: `torch`, `tensorflow`, or `face_generator` libraries depending on implementation.

Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
